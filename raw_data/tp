31044	Trade Policy	to the contrary, we make honest money when there is peace and fair equal trade among nations. we make corrupt money when their is war. maybe i am wrong but so far it seems likes trumps tough talk is actually bringing about good things. better than giving iran pallets of cash	FAVOR
31045	Trade Policy	they aren't really trade wars.  they're aggressive negotiations.  trump's long-stated goal is global free trade, zero tariffs anywhere.  he can't get to that deal without leverage.  war management is not great, but it ain't worse than obama or bush.	FAVOR
31046	Trade Policy	to be true, if the gop would care about the deficit they would stop trump from going into a trade war with the whole world including china and mexico. they would have also stop him from enacting his tax cuts to the rich which just added another trillion to the debt. #truthhurts	FAVOR
31047	Trade Policy	hugh,s position is that trump is such a good negotiator that the mexicans didn,t do things they agreed to do quickly enough, so trump had to threaten yet another trade war with an ally while our economy slows down    	FAVOR
31048	Trade Policy	media: the economy is doing bad because of the "trade war?  reality: the economy is improving due to   renegotiating bad deals and gaining respect, starting to bring jobs back to the us (they call it a trade war).  [they] live in an inverted reality.	FAVOR
31049	Trade Policy	i'm sure another tax cut for corporations and the upper upper crust while starting a trade war, building a useless wall, and increasing spending on defense, space force, and the military industrial complex will fix the problem.	FAVOR
31050	Trade Policy	yes, how dare he pull-off a great trade deal while he's busy winning a trade war somewhere else. do you even listen to yourself? the american people are winning and all you can do is complain about the hardships of a current battle, that is also on the verge of being won.	FAVOR

31057	Trade Policy	unemployment has been trending down for years. it takes a couple of years for policies to have impact. let's hope the latest figures aren't the beginning of a slowdown but reflect a temporary unease with the tradewar with china and the tensions with iran.	FAVOR
31058	Trade Policy	trade war is a facade. there will never be an agreement. china have too many internal battles to contend with and realistically, the us are only doing it as a corporatist move.	FAVOR
31059	Trade Policy	unfortunately, when i returned home last month, i saw the news and many chinese around were incredible confident and proud. however, even without understanding the reasons behind the trade war, but they always have a kind of blind pride and patriotism, which is obviously wrong.	FAVOR
31060	Trade Policy	trump listen to the people and fight for us. he fight for our jobs by declaring trade war with china and opening more mines/fracking etc. the left keeps creating policy that do not relate or as priority by the the people i.e. environment & helping 3rd worlds.	FAVOR

31063	Trade Policy	i'll admit that i'm pleasantly surprised that an agreement was reached surg mexico to avoid any trade war. tariffs don't have a good track record. but it worked this time. congrats on the win, @realdonaldtrump.	FAVOR
31064	Trade Policy	this is exactly why we need to win this trade war. china needs to be put in their place.	FAVOR
31065	Trade Policy	as much as i love a good trump win, i have to credit this mostly to mexican leadership. they understand that although illegal immigration may not be their problem, a trade war with the us is sure to bankrupt mexico and likely hurt the us as well. they picked the lesser of 2 evils	FAVOR

31068	Trade Policy	in reality, chinese stability is important to the u.s. we americans enjoy competition. competition and rivalry improves innovation on both sides. look at the 5g platforms in china. this trade war helps both nations improve. i hope that this competition creates respect:)	FAVOR
31069	Trade Policy	since the us cant invade china, and china is allowed to have nuclear wmds by international convention...the best the us can do now is call them thieves and start unnecessary trade war.	FAVOR
31070	Trade Policy	president trump wins trade war with mexico and further secures the border!!!  #unitedstates  #openborders  #mexico   	FAVOR
31071	Trade Policy	it will be, trump is an extremely intelligent human. the reason he started the trade war was to push the fed into lowering interest rates. once they are lowered he will solve the trade war.	FAVOR
31072	Trade Policy	mexico wanted to make a deal and did! trade war ended before it had even begun. ccp is too busy saving face to make the smart choice, the chinese people and small business suffers for it.	FAVOR
31073	Trade Policy	you must have missed the last 6 years unemployment has been dropping since the great recession... the economy is weakening because of the trade war with china.  we're a service-tech based economy we don't want a trade to be balanced.  	FAVOR
31074	Trade Policy	china unfairly subsidizes its products, dumps on the world market, and is waging a one-sided trade war against the conservative parts of the country, all apparently with your party,s blessing.   will you stand up to them with tariffs?	FAVOR

31081	Trade Policy	don't expect to talk to brainwashed fools every time you're online, some of us can discern idle talk from the policies that are put into practice. trump is correct to focus on the economy and trade rather than war, conquest and international control through threat of force.	FAVOR
31082	Trade Policy	+ i agree this won,t be the case the longer the trade war remains and as it escalates. there will be more pass through to the consumer. the absolute narrative that tariffs are 100% a tax on consumers is false and simply a biased political statement.	FAVOR
31083	Trade Policy	i like to thank trump for creating a  trade war with mexico and then weaseled his way out just like the border wall!	FAVOR

31098	Trade Policy	stupid trade war? excuse me sir, you've ignored the fact that china has been stealing american intellectual property and breaking trade promises. this has been hurting the us!	FAVOR
31099	Trade Policy	far better to trade with a reliable nation like china that will reliably demand and then steal your intellectual property as a cost of doing business while building up a war chest to prop up a communist police state.	FAVOR

31105	Trade Policy	the same patriot farmers you,re still actively completely fucking over with your preposterous un-win-able trade war with china, yeah? those farmers	FAVOR
31106	Trade Policy	follow me now. trump creates a fake crisis which is not a crisis to start with so he can solve a crisis that was never a crisis to begin with. it was never a tariff plan or trade war issue. he just simply made it up to act like he,s governing. #dumbass	FAVOR
31107	Trade Policy	a china trade war, to the tune of a $28,000,000 farm bailout of your money means it is incumbent on everyone who gets it to explain it to everyone else, & encourage them to vote. the one good thing trump has done for  is to politically engage your country like never before.	FAVOR

31127	Trade Policy	the entire point of creating this disaster was the risk; trump presumed mexico would sign on. guess what? it happened. because in the end, the us would win a trade war. tariffs are bad, but not because they will crash the economy. more like they hurt us internationally.	FAVOR
